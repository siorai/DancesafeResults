# Graphs

d2b comes with several generators for drawing graphs on an axis chart. They can be used on their own or as components when using the d2b [axisChart](../charts/axis.md) generator. All the generators use a similar interface which makes them interchangeable in an [axisChart](../charts/axis.md).

Here is the current list of d2b graph generators:

* [area](area.md) - basic area graphs
* [bar](bar.md) - basic bar graphs
* [boxPlot](box_plot.md) - box plots
* [bubblePack](bubble_pack.md) - expandable bubble hierarchies
* [line](line.md) - basic line graphs
* [scatter](scatter.md) - basic scatter graphs
