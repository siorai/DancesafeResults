## What is it?

D2B is a d3-based reusable charting library.

## Why use it?

There are several reasons to use d2b. Here are some of them:

* It is built using a similar module design as d3, using rollup.js as a bundler.
* Although it uses a similar implementation pattern as d3, it's purpose is to give you a suite of charts to use out of the box.  
* The module design pattern exposes internal d2b and d3 components that can be reconfigured to fit your needs.
* Each d2b component has an extensive API that can be configured.
* Built using the latest major release of d3 v4.\*\*
* All components are built to handle seemless transitions between data sets.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d2b`. Otherwise you can download the latest build [here](https://github.com/d2bjs/d2b). CDN coming soon.

## API Reference

You can see the d2b API references [here](http://docs.d2bjs.org).

## Examples

You can try out many d2b examples [here](http://d2bjs.org).

## Optional Dependencies

- [font awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/): Many of the charts use this icon set.

- [d3-sankey](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey): Used by the d2b [sankey chart](./charts/sankey.md) and [sankey svg](./svg/sankey.md). If using NPM this dependency will automatically be included.

- [d3-interpolate-path](https://github.com/pbeshai/d3-interpolate-path): Used by the d2b `v >= 0.0.41` [line svg](./svg/line.md) and [area svg](./svg/area.md) for smoother interpolation. This dependency is optional, by default d3's path interpolation will be used. If installing with NPM this dependency will automatically be included.

- [d3-annotation](http://d3-annotation.susielu.com/): Used by d2b `v >= 0.0.43`. This dependency is only necessary if you are planning to use axis chart annotations. If installing with NPM this dependency will automatically be included.

## Future Components

Here is a list of components that I plan to add in the future.

* **d2b.chartBubble** - A bubble pack chart component with grouping and plotting for change over time.
* **d2b.chartRadar** - A radar chart component. Might also require a d2b.svgRadar component.
* **d2b.chartGauge** - A convenience gauge chart component. This is currently achievable through the pie chart.
* **d2b.chartScatterMatrix** - A scatter-matrix chart component. Will likely use canvas and render queueing to allow for many more points to be drawn.
* **d2b.chartParallelCoordinates** - A parallel-coordinates chart component. Will likely use canvas and render queueing to allow for many more lines to be drawn.
