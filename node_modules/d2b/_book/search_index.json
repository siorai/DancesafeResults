is it?\nD2B is a d3-based reusable charting library.\nWhy use it?\nThere are several reasons to use d2b. Here are some of them:\n\nIt is built using a similar module design as d3, using rollup.js as a bundler.\nAlthough it uses a similar implementation pattern as d3, it's purpose is to give you a suite of charts to use out of the box.  \nThe module design pattern exposes internal d2b and d3 components that can be reconfigured to fit your needs.\nEach d2b component has an extensive API that can be configured.\nBuilt using the latest major release of d3 v4.**\nAll components are built to handle seemless transitions between data sets.\n\nInstalling\nIf you use NPM, npm install d2b. Otherwise you can download the latest build here. CDN coming soon.\nAPI Reference\nYou can see the d2b API references here.\nExamples\nYou can try out many d2b examples here.\nOptional Dependencies\n\nfont awesome icons: Many of the charts use this icon set.\n\nd3-sankey: Used by the d2b sankey chart and sankey svg. If using NPM this dependency will automatically be included.\n\nd3-interpolate-path: Used by the d2b v >= 0.0.41 line svg and area svg for smoother interpolation. This dependency is optional, by default d3's path interpolation will be used. If installing with NPM this dependency will automatically be included.\n\nd3-annotation: Used by d2b v >= 0.0.43. This dependency is only necessary if you are planning to use axis chart annotations. If installing with NPM this dependency will automatically be included.\n\n\nFuture Components\nHere is a list of components that I plan to add in the future.\n\nd2b.chartBubble - A bubble pack chart component with grouping and plotting for change over time.\nd2b.chartRadar - A radar chart component. Might also require a d2b.svgRadar component.\nd2b.chartGauge - A convenience gauge chart component. This is currently achievable through the pie chart.\nd2b.chartScatterMatrix - A scatter-matrix chart component. Will likely use canvas and render queueing to allow for many more points to be drawn.\nd2b.chartParallelCoordinates - A parallel-coordinates chart component. Will likely use canvas and render queueing to allow for many more lines to be drawn.\n\n"},"charts/charts.html":{"url":"charts/charts.html","title":"Charts","keywords":"","body":"\nd2b › Charts\n\nCharts\nd2b comes with several reusable chart generators.\nHere is the current list of d2b chart generators:\n\naxis - axis chart for rendering line-graphs, bar-graphs, etc..

This array will be formed by concatenating all of the graph values and invoking the px and py accessor for each. Each value will have two elements from this visible points array, one for the discrete point's y0 and one for y1.

This is shown in the data example below.\n\n# bubblePack(context)\nRender the bubblePack(s) to the given context, which may be either a d3-selection of SVG containers (either SVG or G elements) or a corresponding d3-transition.\nBefore applying the d2b-bubblePack generator, you should join the data to the selected element(s) using selection.data or selection.datum.

The purpose of this module is to provide a common graph API used in other types of graphs (e.g. scatter, line, bar).\nWhen using the d2b-scatter generator you can draw multiple scatter graphs onto each element in the selection. This is shown in the data example below.\n\n# scatter(context)\nRender the scatter(s) to the given context, which may be either a d3-selection of SVG containers (either SVG or G elements) or a corresponding d3-transition.\nBefore applying the d2b-scatter generator, you should join the data to the selected element(s) using selection.data or selection.datum.

If d3-stack is not specified, returns the current d3-stack generator, which defaults to d3.stack().\nThe d3-stack can be configured at will, except for the keys and values properties which will be set automatically by the scatter generator.\nUsually scatter graphs are not stacked by themselves, but if they are used to overlay on a stacked area graph then stacking should be used to make sure they are aligned.\n\n# scatter.annotation([d3-annotation])\nIf d3-annotation is specified, sets the annotation generator to the specified d3-annotation and returns the scatter generator. If d3-annotation is not specified, returns the current annotation generator, which defaults to a d3.annotation().\n\n# scatter.x([x])\nIf x is specified, sets the x scale to the specified d3-scale and returns the scatter generator.

A more advanced method of stacking allows to stack specific graphs together, this can be done by using a stack property on the graph and setting the stackBy accessor accordingly. In the example below there will be two graphs stacked together under the key 1, two graphs stacked together under the key 2, and one other graph that is denoted as stack 3.\nscatter.stackBy(function (d) {\n  return d.stack;\n});\n\ndata = {\n  graphs: [\n    {\n      label: 'Scatter Graph 1',\n      stack: 1,\n      values: []\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Scatter Graph 2',\n      stack: 1,\n      values: []\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Scatter Graph 3',\n      stack: 2,\n      values: []\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Scatter Graph 4',\n      stack: 2,\n      values: []\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Scatter Graph 5',\n      stack: 3,\n      values: []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n# scatter.symbol([symbol])\nIf symbol is specified, sets the graph symbol accessor to the specified accessor function and returns the scatter generator. If symbol is not specified, returns the current symbol accessor, which defaults to (d) => d3.symbolCircle.\nThis property should be set to one of the preset or custom d3 symbols. This symbol type will set the default symbol type for an entire graph.\n\n# scatter.key([key])\nIf key is specified, sets the graph key accessor to the specified accessor function and returns the scatter generator. If key is not specified, returns the current key accessor, which defaults to (d) => d.label.\nIf you are transitioning from one data set to another the key function is useful in making sure the proper graphs get updated to their corresponding values.\n\n# scatter.color([color])\nIf color is specified, sets the color accessor to the specified accessor function and returns the scatter generator. If color is not specified, returns the current color accessor, which defaults to:\n// define d3 color scale that will be used in the accessor\nvar color = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10);\n\nfunction (d) {\n  return color(d.label);\n}\n\nIf you are transitioning from one data set to another the key function is useful in making sure the proper graphs get updated to their corresponding values.\n\n# scatter.values([values])\nIf values is specified, sets the values array to the specified accessor function or array and returns the scatter generator.

If annotation is not specified, returns the current annotation accessor, which defaults to:\nfunction (d) {\n  return d.annotation;\n}\n\nAnnotations \nThe scatter graph generator has built in hooks for annotations using the d3.annotation plugin. Each value in a scatter graph may contain an annotation at its (x, y) location. For example, a scatter value with an annotation:\n{\n  x: 2,\n  y: 41,\n  annotation: {\n    // dx/dy pixel offset that the annotation has from the value\n    dy: -150,\n    dx: -150,\n    // use a custom annotation type from d3.annotation\n    type: d3.annotationCalloutCircle,\n    note: {\n      title: 'Important Point'\n    },\n    subject: {\n      radius: 20,\n      radiusPadding: 5\n    },\n    connector: {\n      end : \"arrow\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOther Methods\n\n# scatter.getComputedGraphs(context)\nReturns the array of computed graphs for the context's datum. This is not the same as the graphs array provided in the datum. This is a constructed graphs array that invokes all of the accessors described above. Usually this is used internally by the d2b.chartAxis module.\n\n# scatter.getVisiblePoints(context)\nReturns the array of visible points. This array will be formed by concatenating all of the graph values and invoking the px and py accessor for each. This is helpful when trying to dynamically update the scale domains based on the range of x and y values. Usually this is used internally by the d2b.chartAxis module.\n"},"svg/sankey.html":{"url":"svg/sankey.html","title":"d2b.svgSankey","keywords":"","body":"\nd2b › SVG Sankey\n\n\n\n# d2b.svgSankey()\nConstructs a new sankey generator with the default settings.\n\n# sankey(context)\nRender the sankey(s) to the given context, which may be either a d3-selection of SVG containers (either SVG or G elements) or a corresponding d3-transition.\nBefore applying the d2b-sankey generator, you should join the data to the selected element(s) using selection.data or selection.datum.

Here is a simple example using the tooltip axis for two \"graphs\".\nvar svg = d3.select('svg');\n\n// construct a graph of circles\n\nvar circleData = [\n  {x: 100, y: 100, color: 'red'},\n  {x: 200, y: 200, color: 'purple'},\n  {x: 300, y: 300, color: 'blue'},\n  {x: 400, y: 400, color: 'green'},\n]\n\nvar circle = svg.selectAll('circle').data(circleData);\n\ncircle.enter()\n  .append('circle')\n    .attr('r', 10)\n    .style('fill', function (d) { return d.color; })\n    .attr('cx', function (d) { return d.x; })\n    .attr('cy', function (d) { return d.y; });\n\n// construct a graph of rects\n\nvar rectData = [\n  {x: 100, y: 320, color: 'orange'},\n  {x: 200, y: 36, color: 'gray'},\n  {x: 300, y: 450, color: 'steelblue'},\n  {x: 400, y: 310, color: 'black'},\n]\n\nvar rect = svg.selectAll('rect').data(rectData);\n\nrect.enter()\n  .append('rect')\n    .attr('width', 10)\n    .attr('height', 10)\n    .style('fill', function (d) { return d.color; })\n    .attr('x', function (d) { return d.x - 5; })\n    .attr('y', function (d) { return d.y - 5; });\n\n\n// configure the tooltip-axis\n\nvar tooltipAxis = d2b.tooltipAxis();\n\ntooltipAxis\n  // svg container to know where to add grid markers\n  .svgContainer(svg)\n  // size of the axis\n  .size({width: 500, height: 500})\n  // title or header accessor for the tooltip\n  .title(function (d) { return d[0].x; })\n  // row accessor for the tooltip\n  .row(function (d) { return d.y; })\n  // row-color accessor for the tooltip\n  .color(function (d) { return d.color; })\n  // max distance that a tooltip will be generated for a set of points\n  .threshold(100)\n  // container where the mouse events will be bound\n  .tracker(svg);\n\n// create circle tooltip graph and supply data\ntooltipAxis.graph('circle').data(circleData);\n\n// create rect tooltip graph and supply data\ntooltipAxis.graph('rect').data(rectData);\n\n\n# d2b.tooltipAxis()\nConstructs a new tooltipAxis generator.\n\n# tooltipAxis.htmlContainer([selection])\nIf selection is specified, the html container will be set. Newly created tooltips will be placed within this container. If selection is not specified, returns the current tooltip selection. The default selection is d3.select('body').\n\n# tooltipAxis.svgContainer([selection])\nIf selection is specified, the svg container will be set. The svgContainer is used to insert grid markers to illustrate the closest axis-chart point(s). It is also used to identify the (0, 0) pixel position axis relative to the document. If selection is not specified, returns the current svg container.\n\nThe svgContainer must be a svg or g element.\nThe top left (0, 0) corner of the svgContainer must be exactly aligned with the top left corner of the axes.\n\n\n# tooltipAxis.tracker([selection])\nIf selection is specified, the event tracker element will be set. The tracker element is used to bind mouseover, mouseout, and mousemove tooltip events. These events are used for creating, updating, and destroying the tooltip components. If selection is not specified, returns the current tracker, which defaults to d3.select('body').\n\n# tooltipAxis.trackX([boolean])\nIf boolean is specified, the x tracking will be enabled or disabled. If boolean is true the tooltip will search for points that are closest to the cursor in the horizontal direction. If boolean is false the tooltip will include the whole range of point x-values. At least one of trackX or trackY must be true. If boolean is not specified returns the current track-x boolean, which defaults to true.\n\n# tooltipAxis.trackY([boolean])\nIf boolean is specified, the y tracking will be enabled or disabled. If boolean is true the tooltip will search for points that are closest to the cursor in the vertical direction. If boolean is false the tooltip will include the whole range of point y-values. At least one of trackX or trackY must be true. If boolean is not specified returns the current track-x boolean, which defaults to false.\n\n# tooltipAxis.size([size])\nIf size is specified, sets the size of the axes. Size is used to properly determine the width / height of the tooltip grid-markers. Size should be an object in the format {width: 960, height: 500}. If size is not specified returns the current size.\n\n# tooltipAxis.clear([groupName[, graphName]])\nIf groupName and graphName are specified, clears the specific tooltip graph data. If groupName is specified but not graphName then the data for the entire group is cleared. If no arguments are supplied, then all tooltip data will be cleared.\n\n# tooltipAxis.title([title])\nIf title is specified, sets the title-accessor to the specified function or string. If title is not specified, returns the current title-accessor, which defaults to () => null. This accessor will determine what is set as the title of the tooltip when rendered. It is supplied with the set of points to be rendered as rows in the tooltip.\ntooltipAxis.title( function (rows) {\n  // An appropriate title might be the common x-value,\n  // assuming the tooltip is used for x-tracking.\n  return rows[0].x;\n\n  // The returned title can also be html. For example,\n  // if the title needs to be in italics.\n  return '' + rows[0].x + '';\n});\n\nTooltip Row Accessors\nThe following tooltip accessors will be invoked for each row in each of the supplied graphs. The accessors will be supplied with the point data d and index within their corresponding graph i.\n\n# tooltipAxis.x([x])\nIf x is specified, sets the x-accessor to the specified function or string. If x is not specified, returns the current x-accessor, which defaults to () => d.x. The x-accessor identifies the x pixel location of each point relative to the axes.\nvar width = 960;\nvar x = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range([0, width]);\n\ntooltipAxis.x( function (d) {\n  return x(d.x);\n});\n\n\n# tooltipAxis.y([y])\nIf y is specified, sets the y-accessor to the specified function or string. If y is not specified, returns the current y-accessor, which defaults to () => d.y. The y-accessor identifies the y pixel location of each point relative to the axes.\nvar height = 500;\nvar y = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 50]).range([0, height]);\n\ntooltipAxis.y( function (d) {\n  return y(d.y);\n});\n\n\n# tooltipAxis.color([color])\nIf color is specified, sets the color-accessor to the specified function or string. If color is not specified, returns the current color-accessor, which defaults to null. The color-accessor determines what color should be associated with each row in the rendered tooltip.\n\n# tooltipAxis.row([row])\nIf row is specified, sets the row-accessor to the specified function or string. If row is not specified, returns the current row-accessor, which defaults to null. This accessor will determine what is set for each row of the rendered tooltip.\ntooltipAxis.row( function (d) {\n  // An appropriate title might be the y-value,\n  // assuming the tooltip is used for x-tracking.\n  return d.y;\n\n  // The returned title can also be html. For example,\n  // if the row needs to be bold.\n  return '' + d.y + '';\n});\n\n\n# tooltipAxis.on([type[, listener]])\nRegisters the specified listener to receive events of the specified type from the tooltip behavior. (see d3's dispatch for additional details.) The following events are supported:\n\ninsert  - when a tooltip is inserted\nmove    - when a tooltip is moved\nremove  - when a tooltip is removed\n\nEach listener will be supplied with the tooltip selection this, and input arguments for the data and selection index.\nTooltip Axis Graph\nIn order to populate the tooltip with point data you must specify one or more graphs.\n\n# tooltipAxis.graph([groupName[, graphName]])\nReturns the current or creates a new tooltip graph that is identified by the supplied groupName and graphName. If either groupName or graphName are unspecified, null will be used.\nvar graph = tooltipAxis.graph('bar', 'one');\n\n\n# graph.addPoint(point)\nUsed to add an individual point to the graph data array.\ngraph.addPoint({x: 10, y: 52});\n\n\n# graph.data(data)\nUsed to set the graph data to the supplied array of points.\ngraph.data([\n  {x: 10, y: 52},\n  {x: 20, y: 31},\n  {x: 30, y: 86},\n  {x: 40, y: 33},\n]);\n\n\n# graph.x(x)\nIf x is specified, sets the x-accessor to the specified function or string. If x is not specified, returns the current x-accessor. The x-accessor identifies the x pixel location of each point relative to the axes. When this accessor returns non-null it will override the tooltip's x-accessor, thus allowing the user to have custom accessors for each graph.\nvar width = 960;\nvar x = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range([0, width]);\n\ngraph.x( function (d) {\n  return x(d.x);\n});\n\n\n# graph.y(y)\nIf y is specified, sets the y-accessor to the specified function or string. If y is not specified, returns the current y-accessor. The y-accessor identifies the y pixel location of each point relative to the axes. When this accessor returns non-null it will override the tooltip's y-accessor, thus allowing the user to have custom accessors for each graph.\nvar height = 500;\nvar y = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range([0, height]);\n\ngraph.y( function (d) {\n  return y(d.y);\n});\n\n\n# graph.color(color)\nIf color is specified, sets the color-accessor to the specified function or string. If color is not specified, returns the current color-accessor. The color-accessor determines what color should be associated with each row in the rendered tooltip. When this accessor returns non-null it will override the tooltip's color-accessor, thus allowing the user to have custom accessors for each graph.\n\n# graph.row(row)\nIf row is specified, sets the row-accessor to the specified function or string. If row is not specified, returns the current row-accessor. This accessor will determine what is set for each row of the rendered tooltip. When this accessor returns non-null it will override the tooltip's row-accessor, thus allowing the user to have custom accessors for each graph.\ngraph.row( function (d) {\n  // An appropriate title might be the y-value,\n  // assuming the tooltip is used for x-tracking.\n  return d.y;\n\n  // The returned title can also be html. For example,\n  // if the row needs to be bold.\n  return '' + d.y + '';\n});\n\n\nUsing Tooltip Axis with a d2b-graph\nAll of the d2b-graph types can be configured to easily use the tooltip-axis. To do this simply supply each graph object with it's own tooltipAxis.graph. The example below is for a line graph but this functionality extends to all graph types.\nvar line = d2b.svgLine(),\n    x = d3.scaleLinear().domain([1, 5]).range([0, 960]),\n    y = d3.scaleLinear().domain([100, 0]).range([0, 500]);\n\nline.x(x).y(y);\n\nvar svg = d3.select('svg');\n\n// construct and confiture the tooltip axis\nvar tooltipAxis = d2b.tooltipAxis();\n\ntooltipAxis\n  .svgContainer(svg)\n  .tracker(svg)\n  .title(function (d) { return d[0].x; })\n  .row(function (d) { return d.y; })\n  .size({width: 960, height: 500});\n\nsvg\n  .datum([\n    {\n      label: 'Line Graph 1',\n      // add a tooltip graph for the first line graph\n      tooltipGraph: tooltipAxis.graph('line', 'graph 1'),\n      values: [\n        { x: 1, y: 22 },\n        { x: 2, y: 41 },\n        { x: 3, y: 36 },\n        { x: 4, y: 51 },\n        { x: 5, y: 10 }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Line Graph 2',\n      // and for the second line graph\n      tooltipGraph: tooltipAxis.graph('line', 'graph 2'),\n      values: [\n        { x: 1, y: 12 },\n        { x: 2, y: 15 },\n        { x: 3, y: 60 },\n        { x: 4, y: 31 },\n        { x: 5, y: 40 }\n      ]\n    }\n  ])\n  .call(line);\n\n"},"utils/tween_arc.html":{"url":"utils/tween_arc.html","title":"d2b.tweenArc","keywords":"","body":"\nd2b › Tween Arc\n\n\nThis function is used to tween a d3.arc from one position to another.\n\n# d2b.tweenArc(context, arc)\nTween the context arc, which may be either a d3-selection of svg path elements or a corresponding d3-transition.\nThe previous arc will be derived from the node's this.current \"sticky\" property.\nThe arc should be a d3-arc.
